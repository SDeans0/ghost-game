          <h2>Rules</h2>
            <p>Black Maria is a trick taking game with no trumps.
            Hearts won in any trick are penalty points (face value, 10 for royalty, 15 for the Ace), as is the Queen of Spades (50 points).
            A third of the deck is dealt to each player (minus the 2 of clubs in three player mode). Winning all the points (149) is <i>Shooting the Moon</i> - a player who does this is awarded 0 points and the others get 149 each.
            Before play, you pass three cards onto the next player.
            The person who opened the room begins the game.
            After that, the winner of the trick leads.
